# if an year is divisible by four then it is a leap year otherwise not 
year = int(input("enter a number "))
if year%4 == 0 and year%100 != 0 or year%4 == 0 and year%100 == 0 and year%400 == 0:
    print("leap year")

# 1900 is not a leap year

#         print("leap year")
# else:
#     print("not a leap year")

if an year is divisible by 4 and it is not divisible divisible by 100 then it is a leap year 
if a year is divisible by four and it is divisible by 100 then check if it is also divisible by 400 
if yes then it is a leap year 

# Year = int(input("enter a year "))
# if Year < 366:
#     print("not a leap year")
# else:
#     print("A leap year")
